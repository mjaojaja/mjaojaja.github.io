	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the theory of plate tectonics, the upper portion of the Earth’s <a class="hideDisplay"><font color="blue"><ins>lithosphere</ins></font><span class="showDisplayOnHover"><span class="showBodyOfDisplayOnHover">The rigid outer part of the Earth, consisting of the crust and upper mantle.</span></span></a>,
	which contains the heavier oceanic and the lighter <a class="hideSmallCenterDisplay"><font color="blue"><ins>continental</ins></font><span class="showSmallCenterDisplayOnHover"><span class="showBodyOfSmallCenterDisplayOnHover">Related to a mainland.</span></span></a>
	<a class="hideMediumDisplay"><font color="blue"><ins>crusts</ins></font><span class="showMediumDisplayOnHover"><span class="showBodyOfMediumDisplayOnHover">The earth’s rocky  outer layer.</span></span></a>, consists of a series of rigid plates that are in constant motion.
	This theory provides a <font style="background-color:silver">cohesive</font> model to explain the integrated actions of continental drift, seafloor spreading, and mountain formation.
	
	<br>
	<br>
	
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earth’s plates are estimated to have an average depth of approximately 
	60 miles (or 100 kilometers), but they are believed to vary considerably in size.
	Some are estimated to be continental or even hemispheric in size, while other are believed to be much smaller. Though the actual boundaries and sizes 
	and shapes of the plates are not known for sure, it has been <font style="background-color:silver">postulated</font> that there are six major plates and somewhere around the same number of smaller ones. Most of the plates consist of both sial (continental) and sima (oceanic) crust.
	They are in constant movement, though they move at an extremely slow pace, and these movements cause frequent interactions between plates.
	
	<br>
	<br>
	
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font style="background-color:silver">At this time</font>, 
	scientists have identified three different types of boundaries between plates. At a <strong>divergent</strong> boundary, plates are moving away from each other.
	This type of boundary occurs at an oceanic ridge, where new material is being added to the 
	seafloor from deeper within the Earth. Shallow earthquakes and underwater volcanoes are associated with this type of plate activity. 
	At a <strong>convergent</strong> boundary, plates are moving toward each other and collide, causing vast folding and 
	<a class="hideSmallCenterDisplay"><font color="blue"><ins>crumpling</ins></font><span class="showSmallCenterDisplayOnHover"><span class="showSmallCenterBodyOfDisplayOnHover">Press into wrinkles.</span></span></a> along the edges of the plates.
	In addition to the folding and crumpling, one of the plates slowly folds under the other.
	Though this <font style="background-color:silver">subduction</font> is slow, it can nonetheless be quite 
	<a class="hideSmallCenterDisplay"><font color="blue"><ins>catastrophic</ins></font><span class="showSmallCenterDisplayOnHover"><span class="showBodyOfSmallCenterDisplayOnHover">Causing great disaster.</span></span></a>
	as the crustal material of the submerging plate gradually melts into 
	the fiery hot depths below. The area where subduction occurs is usually an area where the crust is relatively unstable and is characterized 
	by numerous deep earthquakes and a significant amount of volcanic activity. The boundaries between convergent plates are generally found around 
	the edges of ocean basins and are sometimes <font style="background-color:silver">associated with</font> deep ocean trenches. A third type of boundary is a <strong>transcurrent</strong> boundary, 
	which involves two plates sliding past each other laterally, without the folding and crumpling that occurs at a convergent boundary. 
	This third type of boundary is thought to be far less common than the other two types of boundaries.
	 
	<br>
	<br>
	 
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concept of plate tectonics provides an understanding of the massive rearrangement 
	of the Earth’s crust that has apparently taken place. It is now generally accepted that the single supercontinent known as Pangaea indeed existed, 
	that Pangaea subsequently broke apart into two giant pieces, Gondwanaland in the south and Laurasia in the north, and that the continents attached to 
	the various crustal plates separated and drifted in various directions. As the plates <font style="background-color:silver">drifted</font>, they may have diverged, 
	which was associated with the spread of the seafloor, or they may have converged, which resulted in collision, subduction, and mountain building.
	 
	<br>
	<br>
	 
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of the Earth’s major mountain ranges are found in zones where plates 
	converge. The Himalayas, which are the world’s highest mountains, along with the central Asian mountains of varying heights associated with
	<font style="background-color:silver">them</font>, 
	were formed by the crumpling and folding of two massive plates that collided at a convergent boundary. 
	<font style="background-color:silver">The landmass that is today known as India was originally part of Gondwanaland, the giant supercontinent in the Southern Hemisphere, 
	but it broke off from Gondwanaland approximately 200 million years ago and drifted north to collide with part of Laurasia, 
	the giant supercontinent in the Northern Hemisphere, to create the world’s tallest mountains.</font>
