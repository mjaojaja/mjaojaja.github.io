	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schizophrenia is in reality a cluster of psychological disorders in which 
	a variety of behaviors are exhibited and which are classified in various ways. Though there are numerous behaviors that might be considered schizophrenic, 
	common behaviors that manifest themselves in severe schizophrenic disturbances are thought disorders, delusions, and emotional disorders.	
	<br>
	<br>
	
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because schizophrenia is not a single disease but is in reality a cluster of 
	related disorders, schizophrenics tend to be classified into various subcategories. The various subcategories of schizophrenia are based on the degree to 
	which the various common behaviors are <font style="background-color:silver">manifested in</font> the patient as well as other factors such as the age of 
	the schizophrenic patient at the onset of symptoms and the duration of the symptoms. Five of the more common subcategories of schizophrenia are simple, 
	hebephrenic, paranoid, catatonic, and acute.	
	<br>
	<br>
	
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font style="background-color:silver">The main characteristic of simple 
	schizophrenia is that it begins at a relatively early age and manifests itself in a slow withdrawal from family and social relationships with a 
	gradual progression toward more severe symptoms over a period of years.</font> Someone suffering from simple schizophrenia may early on simply be 
	<font style="background-color:silver">apathetic</font> toward life, may maintain contact with reality a great deal of the time, and may be out in 
	the world rather than hospitalized. Over time, however, the symptoms, particularly thought and emotional disorders, increase in severity.	 
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 
	 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hebephrenic schizophrenia is a relative severe form of the disease that is 
	 characterized by severely disturbed thought processes as well as highly emotional and bizarre behavior. Those suffering from hebephrenic schizophrenia 
	 have hallucinations and delusions and appear quite incoherent; their behavior is often extreme and quite inappropriate to the situation, perhaps full 
	 of <font style="background-color:silver">unwarranted</font> laughter, or tears, or obscenities that seem unrelated to the moment. This type of 
	 schizophrenia represents a rather severe and ongoing disintegration of personality that makes this type of schizophrenic unable to play a role in society.	 
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 
	 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paranoid schizophrenia is a different type of schizophrenia in which the outward 
	 behavior of the schizophrenic often seems quite appropriate; this type of schizophrenic is often able to 
	 <font style="background-color:silver">get along</font> in society for long periods of time. 
	 However, a paranoid schizophrenic suffers from extreme delusions of persecution, often accompanied by delusions of grandeur. 
	 <font style="background-color:silver">While</font> this type of schizophrenic has strange delusions and unusual thought process, 
	 his or her outward behavior is not as incoherent or unusual as a hebephrenic’s behavior. A paranoid schizophrenic can appear alert and 
	 intelligent much of the time but can also turn suddenly hostile and violent in response to imagined threats.	
	
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 
	 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another type of schizophrenia is the catatonic variety, 
	 which is characterized by alternating periods of extreme excitement and stupor. There are abrupt changes in behavior, from frenzied periods of 
	 excitement to stuporous periods of withdrawn behavior. During periods of excitement, the catatonic schizophrenic may exhibit excessive and sometimes 
	 violent behavior; during the periods of stupor, the catatonic schizophrenic may remain <font style="background-color:silver">mute</font> 
	 and unresponsive to the environment.
	 
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 
	 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A final type of schizophrenia is acute schizophrenia, 
	 which is characterized by a sudden onset of schizophrenic symptoms such as confusion, excitement, emotionality, depression, and irrational fear. 
	 The acute schizophrenic, unlike the simple schizophrenic, shows a sudden onset of the disease rather than a slow progression from one stage 
	 of <font style="background-color:silver">it</font> to the other. Additionally, the acute schizophrenic exhibits various types of schizophrenic 
	 behaviors during different episodes, sometimes exhibiting the characteristics of hebephrenic, catatonic, or even paranoid schizophrenia. 
	 In this type of schizophrenia, the patient’s personality seems to have completely disintegrated.
